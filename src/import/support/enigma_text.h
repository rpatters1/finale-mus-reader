/// - the fixed-row eras spell text styles as a run of `^efx(name)` commands where modern
///   Enigma packs them into one `^nfx(bits)`;
/// - the compressed eras write commands in a binary form -- a caret, a one-byte code, and
///   an argument spelled as hexadecimal digits offset by one -- that no modern parser reads.
///
/// What comes out is Enigma text, not plain text: inserts, sizes, and font changes are kept
/// so that musxdom's own parser can resolve them against the imported document.
