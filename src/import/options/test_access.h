// Stages of an options importer, exposed only so that a test can drive one of them alone.
//
// **No library code may include this header.** `import/options.h` states what the registry
// calls -- one importer per musxdom class, and nothing else -- and that is the whole contract
// between an options class and the rest of the reader. Everything here is reachable from an
// importer already; a declaration exists below only because driving the stage through its
// importer would make some test vaguer than it needs to be. Recovering a clef table against a
// purpose-built reference document is the motivating case.
//
// A stage that no test drives does not belong here either. Make it file-local in the class's
// own translation unit, where an anonymous namespace keeps it out of every other file's way.
// Two multimeasure-rest stages were briefly declared here out of symmetry with their
// neighbors, which is the mistake this comment exists to prevent.
